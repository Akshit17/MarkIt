OMR sheets are found used in various areas ranging from registration, admissions, Olympiad exams, entrance exams, competitive exams and even election forms and attendance sheet in some places. That said, omr sheets are either graded manually which utilizes a lot of time and labour or by using Scanners which are very expensive and susceptible to errors such as outnumbering papers placed in tray if their orientation is not correct. 
This repository aims to build a solution for this in form of a omr sheet scanning application using OpenCV image processing techniques.
